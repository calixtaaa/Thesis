## Personal Hygiene Vending Machine (Raspberry Pi Prototype)

**Version:** v1.0.0

A Raspberry Pi–based **personal hygiene vending machine** with an integrated AI chatbot, redesigned UI/UX, and a Vue 3 + Vite website with Tailwind CSS:

- 7" touchscreen GUI (Tkinter) with improved UI/UX design
- **AI Chatbot** for customer support and product recommendations
- Cash and RFID wallet payments
- Advanced product search with icons & smart suggestions
- Inventory management & staff restock mode
- Admin dashboard (overview metrics, charts, reports, analytics)
- SQLite logging of sales transactions
- Excel export for sales reporting (daily / monthly / weekly summaries)
- Light / Dark **theme toggle** on all main screens
- Real-time stock monitoring and alerts

> The app runs on Windows for development (GPIO mocked) and on Raspberry Pi with real hardware. Version and patch notes are centralized in `patchNotes.py`; the database layer lives in `database.py`. The website is now built with Vue 3 + Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Project Structure

### Machine Backend (Python)

- **`main.py`** – Entry point; GUI, hardware abstraction, RFID/product flows, sidebar, theme, chatbot integration. Imports from `database`, `patchNotes`, `admin`, `staff`, `chatbot`.
- **`database.py`** – SQLite connection, schema, seeding, and all DB operations (products, transactions, RFID users, admin credentials, report queries, Excel export, chatbot logs).
- **`patchNotes.py`** – App version (`VERSION`), patch notes content (Added / Improved / Bugs fixed / Future), and `get_patch_notes_text()` for the in-app Patch Notes dialog.
- **`chatbot/`**
  - `chatbot.py` – AI chatbot logic, natural language processing, product recommendations, FAQs.
  - `responses.py` – Predefined responses and templates.
- **`admin/`**
  - `admin.py` – `AdminMixin`: admin login, dashboard UI, charts, sales reports screen, change credentials.
  - `reports.py` – Report paths (`get_reports_dir()` = Downloads/Hygiene Vending Reports), list/open reports.
- **`staff/`**
  - `staff.py` – `StaffMixin`: staff RFID login, restock screen, restock dialog.
- **`images/`** – Icons (hamburger, search, backspace, theme, admin, staff, chatbot).

### Website Frontend (Vue 3 + Vite)

- **`src/`** – Vue 3 source files
  - `main.js` – Entry point
  - `App.vue` – Root component
  - `components/` – Reusable Vue components
  - `views/` – Page components (Dashboard, Analytics, Reports, etc.)
  - `stores/` – Pinia state management
  - `utils/` – Helper functions and API calls
- **`public/`** – Static assets
- **`vite.config.js`** – Vite configuration
- **`tailwind.config.js`** – Tailwind CSS configuration
- **`index.html`** – HTML entry point

**Generated / runtime:**

- **`vending.db`** – SQLite database (products, transactions, RFID users, admin settings, chatbot logs).
- **Downloads / Hygiene Vending Reports** – Generated Excel sales reports (`sales_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`).
- **`debug_logs/`** – Debug log files (when debugging is enabled).
- **`bug_reports/`** – Bug report submissions (NDJSON format).

## Requirements

### Software (Windows dev OR Raspberry Pi)

#### Machine (Python)

- Python **3.10+** (3.11+ OK)
- System:
  - Tkinter (for GUI)
  - SQLite (bundled with Python)
  - **RPi.GPIO** only on Raspberry Pi
- Python packages:
  - `openpyxl` (Excel export)
  - `python-dotenv` (environment variables)
  - `requests` (API calls)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Website (Node.js)

- Node.js **16+** (18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd WebSite
npm install
```

### Raspberry Pi setup

On Raspberry Pi OS / Debian-based:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-tk
sudo apt install -y python3-rpi.gpio
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
```

Tkinter is required for the touchscreen GUI. On Windows, GPIO is mocked so you can run and test the UI without hardware.

## How to Run

### Machine

From the project directory:

```bash
python main.py
```

On Raspberry Pi with a 7" touchscreen, the app can run fullscreen; on Windows it uses a resizable window (e.g. 800×480).

### Website (Development)

```bash
cd WebSite
npm run dev
```

The website will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Website (Production Build)

```bash
cd WebSite
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## How It Works (Summary)

- **Startup:** `main.py` calls `init_db()` (in `database.py`), which creates/migrates `vending.db` and seeds:
  - 10 hygiene products (slots 1–10) with Philippine SRP prices
  - Default staff RFID user (`STAFF001`)
  - Default admin credentials (username/password: `admin` / `admin`; change in admin dashboard)
  - Chatbot knowledge base and FAQ entries
- **Main screen:** Scrollable product grid with improved card design, advanced search bar with AI suggestions, navbar (hamburger, theme toggle, chatbot button), footer with real-time status, and integrated chatbot widget
- **AI Chatbot:** Accessible via button on main screen; provides instant customer support, product recommendations, payment help, and FAQ responses
- **Hamburger menu:** Opens a sidebar with Staff (restock) and Admin (dashboard). Admin requires login.
- **Flows:** Select product → quantity → payment (Cash or RFID) → dispense; Buy/Reload RFID; Staff restock; Admin dashboard (charts, generate Excel, view reports, change credentials, analytics)
- **Website:** Vue 3 + Vite dashboard synced with machine data; displays real-time sales, analytics, customer management, and remote administration
- **Version:** Shown in the window title, footer on main screens, and Patch Notes dialog. Bump `VERSION` in `patchNotes.py` for new releases.
